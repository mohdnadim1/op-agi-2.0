import tensorflow as tf
from transformers import pipeline

class AGI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.memory = []  # Basic memory storage
        self.model = tf.keras.Sequential([
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu'),
            tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
        ])
        self.model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
        self.nlp = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")
    
    def learn(self, data, labels):
        """Train the AGI model with labeled data."""
        self.model.fit(data, labels, epochs=10)
    
    def reason(self, input_data):
        """Make a decision based on input data."""
        return self.model.predict(np.array([input_data]))
    
    def remember(self, fact):
        """Store information in memory."""
        self.memory.append(fact)
    
    def recall(self):
        """Retrieve stored memory."""
        return self.memory
    
    def communicate(self, prompt):
        """Use NLP to generate responses."""
        return self.nlp(prompt, max_length=50)[0]['generated_text']
    
# Example Usage:
agi = AGI()
agi.remember("The capital of France is Paris.")
print(agi.recall())
print(agi.communicate("What is the future of AI?"))
```
